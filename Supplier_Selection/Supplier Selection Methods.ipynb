    "# Supplier Ranking Methods (Multi-criteria Decision-Making or MCDM)\n",
    "Prepared by: Nickolas Freeman, Ph.D.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents techniques for ranking suppliers. These techniques are useful for identifying a subset of candidate suppliers from a potentially large set of available suppliers. The difficulty in such selection tasks is that oftentimes there are several competing criteria that we would like to use for evaluation. For example, buying firms care about both cost and quality. However, it may be impossible to find a supplier that offers exceptional performance with respect to both criteria because the two criteria may be negatively correlated (e.g., the supplier is able to offer products at a lower cost because they do not enforce very stringent quality controls). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another complicating factor is that it is common for a buying firm to be interested in both quantitative and qualitative criteria. However, comparing scores for quantitative and qualitative aspects is difficult. For example, how much of a cost increase is improved technical support or sustainability efforts worth? The approaches we consider in this notebook assign a quantitative score to subjective criteria and employ relatively simple weighting techniques to determine overall scores. A hyperlinked table of contents follows.\n",

To apply such a rule, we will construct a dictionary of zip codes that contains the appropriate values. We will then map this dictionary back onto the data as we did when considering supplier credit scores. The first step in doing this is to determine all of the unique (city, state, zip code) tuples in the data. This is accomplished in the following code block. The first five tuples are printed.\n",

In particular, notice that the values in the `Location Sales Volume Actual` column are significantly larger than those in the `Open Saturday`, `Open Sunday`, `Credit Score Num`, and `Zip Code Score` columns. Depending on the raking method we use, this could cause the rankings to be overly biased by the sales volume. In general, it is good to normalize all values that we will be using for the ranking so that they range from zero to one. The following code block shows how we can use the `MinMaxScaler` from the `sklearn.preprocessing` modules to rescale the values.\n",

    "\n",
    ">[The weighted sum method determines a] weighted point [estimate for each alternative], which consider attributes that are weighted by the buyer. The weight for each attribute is then multiplied by the performance score that is assigned. Finally, these products are totaled to determine final rating for each supplier. Typically this system is designed to utilize quantitative measurements. The advantages of the weighted point method include the ability for the organization to include numerous evaluation factors and assign them weights according to the organization’s needs. The subjective factors on the evaluation are minimized. The major limitation of this approach is that it is difficult to effectively take qualitative evaluation criteria into consideration.\n",

    "# Technique 3: TOPSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now consider the TOPSIS technique. TOPSIS stands for <b>T</b>echnique for <b>O</b>rder of <b>P</b>reference by <b>S</b>imilarity to <b>I</b>deal <b>S</b>olution. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPSIS (accessed on 2/8/18):\n",

    "> TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Hwang and Yoon in 1981 with further developments by Yoon in 1987, and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993. TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS). It is a method of compensatory aggregation that compares a set of alternatives by identifying weights for each criterion, normalising scores for each criterion and calculating the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal alternative, which is the best score in each criterion. An assumption of TOPSIS is that the criteria are monotonically increasing or decreasing. Normalisation is usually required as the parameters or criteria are often of incongruous dimensions in multi-criteria problems. Compensatory methods such as TOPSIS allow trade-offs between criteria, where a poor result in one criterion can be negated by a good result in another criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code cell generates an interactive plot that illustrates the location of the *positive ideal solution* (PIS) and *negative ideal solution* (NIS) for a dataset with two criterion. Note that this representation assumes that higher values of each criteria are better.\n",

    "# Weight Determination via Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now turn our attention to setting weights for a supplier ranking task. This can be a particularly challenging process because the fact that we are including an attribute means it is important to some degree. In this section, we will investigate a technique known as Analytics Heirarchy Process for setting weights. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process (accessed 2/4/2019):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, based on mathematics and psychology. It was developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s and has been extensively studied and refined since then.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Rather than prescribing a \"correct\" decision, the AHP helps decision makers find one that best suits their goal and their understanding of the problem. It provides a comprehensive and rational framework for structuring a decision problem, for representing and quantifying its elements, for relating those elements to overall goals, and for evaluating alternative solutions.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Decision makers systematically evaluate its various [attributes] by comparing them to each other two at a time, with respect to their impact on [a predetermined objective]. In making the comparisons, the decision makers can use concrete data about the elements, but they typically use their judgments about the elements' relative meaning and importance. It is the essence of the AHP that human judgments, and not just the underlying information, can be used in performing the evaluations.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The AHP converts these evaluations to numerical values that can be processed and compared over the entire range of the problem. A numerical weight or priority is derived for each [attribute], allowing diverse and often incommensurable elements to be compared to one another in a rational and consistent way. This capability distinguishes the AHP from other decision making techniques.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In the final step of the process, numerical priorities are calculated for each of the decision alternatives. These numbers represent the alternatives' relative ability to achieve the decision goal, so they allow a straightforward consideration of the various courses of action.\n",

    "As we saw in our earlier discussion of the weighted sum, weighted product, and TOPSIS ranking methods, there are differences in the rankings produced by each method. Also, whenever we perform a ranking, the weights that we use are based on our preferences at the time that the weights are deterimined. Moreover, if we use a technique such as AHP, the waits my include some inherent bias that is associated with the decision makers involved in deriving the pairiwse attribute comparisons. \n",

    "The following code block defines a function that performs a robust ranking evaluation for a specified scoring method. The function allows a user to define a perturbation range that is used to randomly vary the weights for the various criteria in the range +/- the defined perturbation. This is done for a specified number of times and the number of times that a particular supplier appears as a top supplier is counted and plotted. The function returns a `DataFrame` object with the robust ranking results.\n",
